How to play:
Choose your character, and set out on an adventure to find the lost treasures of Neko-land!
On your journey, you would encounter deadly beasts and monsters, that have for 
long prevented others from obtaining the treasures.
Using your character's specialized skills, fight them, defeat them, and win!

Each character can attack an enemy physically or by casting a magic spell, and  the effectiveness would depend on their specialization. You need to keep         attacking the enemy till their HP becomes 0.

Each character also has a certain amount of health points (HP) and magic points (MP). Everytime you cast a magic spell, 10 MP will be used. Whenever a monster  attacks you, your HP would reduce by some amount. If your HP drops to 0 at any   stage, it's game over!

But don't worry, because you can use health potions that you would find on your journey, to restore your health!
		
Let's start!
